Game of Death in HTML5
========================

##About##

Game of Death in HTML5 is an HTML5 port of ["Game of Death Lava"](http://users.fulladsl.be/spb22044/demos/GameOfDeath/index.html) by Vincent "Vulume" Goossens.

I release only the JS source of the demo, as you can easily deploy it to a page using [HTML5 Boilerplate template](https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate) by Paul Irish or you can just create a page with a div id="main" in it to host the game.

##Required libraries##

* [jQuery (1.5.1+)](http://jquery.com)
